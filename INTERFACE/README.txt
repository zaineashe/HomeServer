PYTHON INTERFACE
WILL READ A JSON FILE OF IMAGES
WILL PLAY THOSE IMAGES TO A SCREEN

**NOTES**
Will need to add sizing options
	- This screen goes past the celing
	- So make the window be the size of the screen minus some constant
	- Be able to change that constant

Keep all constants in a seperate file (constants.py)
	- In main interface program, "import constants.py"
	- This will add all the constants from another file
	- Will make maintance easier
